# Bluetooth: Peripheral HIDS keyboard - Turned Sim Racing Wheel/Button Box

This is a modified version of the nRF Peripheral HIDS keyboard example, currently consists of simple buttons, and an interrupt driven output.  Additionally there is battery level reporting and single LED control for use with a rev limiter.

Currently only fully functional with the Adafruit Feather nRF52840

[SimHub Plugin](https://github.com/will-jj/nrf-button-box-simhub) is required for sending the Red Line On/Off state.
